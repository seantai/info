## Introduction

🚀🚀
You have both freedom and responsibility when it comes to **memory management** in your IFC.js app. Fortunately, IFC.js lets you balance these to **release memory** very easily. Let's see how it's done. 👇

<IfcCard>
  🗑️ IFC.js builds upon the Three.js <b>dispose() </b> function. See how IFC.js does it <a href="https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-viewer/blob/master/viewer/src/ifc-viewer-api.ts#L220">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-three/blob/main/web-ifc-three/src/IFC/components/MemoryCleaner.ts">here</a>, and also read what Three.js
  <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-dispose-of-objects"> has to say</a>. 🗑️

## How to do it

### Monitoring the memory

👀 [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/) is a library to **monitor the memory and performance** of your Three.js app, made by the creator of Three.js himself. Let's go ahead and install with `npm i stats.js`, **import**, **initialize** and **attach it** to our viewer.

```js
import Stats from "stats.js/src/Stats";

const stats = new Stats();
addStats();

function addStats() {
    stats.showPanel(2);
    document.body.append(stats.dom);
    viewer.context.stats = stats;
};
```

📋 During development we don't have to second guess our memory management anymore, because now it's **visualized** for us.

<IfcAlert>
  If you don't remember how to setup your viewer, just look at the <a href="https://github.com/IFCjs/hello-world/tree/main/examples/web-ifc-viewer/memory">full example</a> or at previous tutorials.
</IfcAlert>

### Load up the model

⛽⛽ First we'll **create** an HTML **input button** and use `loadIfc()` to load our models from file. 🎨 Style as you wish!

```html
<input type="file" id="input-button" />
```

```js
async function loadIfcFromFile(file) {
  const model = await viewer.IFC.loadIfc(file, true);
}
```

<IfcCard>
  👁️‍🗨️ We call <a href="https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-viewer/blob/master/viewer/src/components/ifc/ifc-manager.ts#L42/">loadIfc()</a> when a user loads an IFC file. Internally, it creates a URL then calls <a href="https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-viewer/blob/master/viewer/src/components/ifc/ifc-manager.ts#L53/"> loadIfcUrl() </a>for us.
</IfcCard>

💅 Now **link** the button and the function.

```js {3}
const input_button = document.getElementById("input-button");
input_button.addEventListener("input", (input) => {
  loadIfcFromFile(input.target.files[0])},
  false
);
```

So that we can load and release the same model over and over, for this example we'll add a tiny hack to reset the DOM event.

```js
input_button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.target.value = "";
});
```

### Dispose memory

✌🥤 Finally let's create our function to **dispose** memory on command using `dispose()`. Here's how it's done:

```js
function releaseMemory() {
  viewer.dispose();
  viewer = null;
  viewer = new IfcViewerAPI({ container });
  viewer.IFC.setWasmPath("../../../");
  addStats();
}
```

❗❗ Keep in mind: Once we call `dispose()`, we need to **re-initialize** our viewer instance (and Stats module)❗❗

⌨️ For this example let's attach our function to a new HTML button.

```html
<input type="button" id="release-button" value="Release Memory" />
```

```js
const release_button = document.getElementById("release-button");
release_button.addEventListener("click", () => releaseMemory());
```

🧪 Try loading a model and releasing the memory: you'll notice our model disappears and our visualizer confirms this. Remember that it **might take time** for the garbage collector to do its job.

## The result

😎 This is how the application looks like:

<Scene link={"https://ifcjs.github.io/hello-world/examples/web-ifc-viewer/memory/index.html"} />

## Next steps

🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations! Your IFC.js apps are now **free of memory leaks**. This memory management will keep your app squeaky clean and running smooth.
